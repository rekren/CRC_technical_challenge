    "The current pipeline aims to stratify patients into molecular subtypes using bulk transcriptomic data, with the overarching goal of linking these subtypes to clinical characteristics. The workflow begins with bulk RNA-seq data, selects the 100 most variable genes, applies hierarchical clustering, and finally compares the resulting clusters to clinical data for interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach is straightforward, there are several critical limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Lack of Normalization and Batch Correction: The pipeline omits normalization and batch effect correction, both of which are essential for RNA-seq analysis. Without these steps, technical variation can dominate the data, causing the “high variance” genes to reflect artifacts rather than true biological differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Simplistic Feature Selection: Selecting the top 100 genes by variance is a coarse strategy, especially for count-based RNA-seq data. Variance-stabilizing methods such as VST or rlog from DESeq2 better account for the mean–variance relationship and reduce bias toward highly expressed genes. Moreover, fixing the number at exactly 100 is arbitrary and may exclude important signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Limited Clustering Strategy: Using only hierarchical clustering restricts the ability to detect diverse patterns in the data. Alternative approaches such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), k-means, or consensus clustering can reveal complementary structure and improve robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Late Integration of Clinical Data: Restricting clinical data use to the final interpretation stage misses the opportunity to guide unsupervised analysis toward clinically meaningful patterns. Early integration, for example through semi-supervised clustering or multi-omics factor analysis, could produce clusters with stronger clinical relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the pipeline could be made more robust by incorporating normalization and batch correction early, using statistically sound feature selection, testing multiple clustering methods, and integrating clinical data throughout the analysis rather than at the very end.\n",
