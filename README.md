# CRC Technical Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the **CRC Technical Challenge**, organized as Jupyter notebooks.  
For the best viewing experience, you can open them either directly on **GitHub** or via **nbviewer**.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If the notebooks are large or contain many plots, **nbviewer** generally renders them faster and more reliably than GitHubâ€™s built-in viewer.
            If neither of them works due to size restriction, you can downlaod the notebooks, as a last resort :)
