# CRC Technical Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the **CRC Technical Challenge**, organized as Jupyter notebooks.  
For the best viewing experience, you can open them either directly on **GitHub** or via **nbviewer**.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The notebooks are large and contain many plots, **nbviewer** generally renders them faster and more reliably than GitHubâ€™s built-in viewer.
            If neither of them works ,as a last resort, you can download the notebooks and explore them further within your favourite IDE :)
